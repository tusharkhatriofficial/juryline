The project_name is \"test\". I need to validate this according to the given rules.\n\nFirst check: project_name must be non-empty. It's \"test\", which is non-empty, so that's valid. No error there.\n\nNext, the submission only includes project_name. The other fields, demo_url and repo_url, are missing. The instructions say to flag missing links, but the user didn't provide them, so those are missing. Are they required? The validation rules mention to check if they are valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs if provided. Since they're not provided, that's not an error, but maybe a warning.\n\nWait, the user didn't include demo_url or repo_url. The rules say to flag missing links. So perhaps the warnings should mention that these URLs are missing. So the warnings list would have entries like \"demo_url is missing\" and \"repo_url is missing\".\n\nNo errors because the required fields (project_name) are valid. Then normalize whitespace. The project_name is \"test\" with no whitespace, so normalization doesn't change it.\n\nSo the final result should be valid: true, warnings about the missing URLs, and the normalized project name. Let me structure that into the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"warnings\": [\"demo_url is missing\", \"repo_url is missing\"],\n  \"errors\": [],\n  \"normalized\": {\n    \"project_name\": \"test\"\n  }\n}"}]}}
